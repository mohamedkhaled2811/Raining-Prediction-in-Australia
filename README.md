# Rainning-Prediction-in-Australia
This repository reviewes rainning prediciton problem using Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and compare it's results with Artifitial Neural Network (ANN).
`weather_australia.ipynb` is a notebook that contains the code that gives an overview of the data set, trainning of SVC and ANN, and it also includes the metrics used to evaluate the two classifiers.
Metriecs used for the evaluation: Confusion matrix, accuracy and ROC curve.
The dataset uploaded in this repository is downloaded from kaggle.
